# Drifting
Designed a web-based drifting car animation using HTML and CSS to simulate motion, rotation, and skid effects. Implemented smooth transitions, keyframe animations, and transform properties to create a realistic drifting effect. Enhanced the visual experience with background road environments, smoke trails, and dynamic wheel movement.
